# Front End Fundamentals

- Static web pages
- They don't collect data.
- Web site without a backend. 

- Deploy a static web site to github pages for free, super easily. 

## HTML

- Hypertext markup language.
- It's a tree, like most view hierarchies.
- `head`, `body`, `header`, `footer`, `div`
- It makes your text hyper and marked up.
- Is just the data. 

## CSS

- Cascading style sheets
- Styling language
- Color, styling layout.

- you can't add logic. 

use a `#` to refer to an id, use a `.` to refer to a class.

## JavaScript

- Up until very recently, javascript was the only option.
- Kinda looks like an unsafe version of swift
- dynamic language
- `coffeescript`, `typescript`, `flow`.

- DOM Document Object Model.

## File Structure

File structure is up to you.

## Frameworks

- use CSS and JavaScript frameworks and libraries just like you would use them in iOS. 
- Download the css and js files, or use a cdn, then write waay less code as the library or framework does most of the work for you.
- Use these to easily add a carousel or popout nav bar, or anything

## Templates

- You don't have to start from scratch, use html templates as a starting point for your project. http://materializecss.com/showcase.html

## Jekyll

* Check out jekyll, it's good for some things.

## Deploying

- Once you have your static site, you can deploy to "the cloud" however you want.

#### github pages (using docs folder)

1. Create a repo, or use an existing repo.
2. Create a `docs` folder on the master branch.
3. put all of your html, css, and js in the docs folder.
4. push your code to github.
5. go to the repo settings page and scroll the the github pages section.
6. enable github pages on master branch and make sure your page works.
